          <span className="text-2xl font-semibold">Hello!</span> <br /> My name
          is Ahbab UZ Zaman and I specialize in front-end development that
          utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, and REACT etc. I am a highly motivated
          individual and eternal optimist dedicated to writing clear, concise,
          robust code that works. Striving to never stop learning and improving.
          When I'm not coding, I am reading blogs on the internet, or playing
          outdoor games. I like to have my perspective and belief systems
          challenged so that I see the world through new eyes.
